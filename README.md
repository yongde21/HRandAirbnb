Predictive Analytics Assignment
There are 2 problems that was assigned for this assignemnt, HR Analytics and Airbnb Singapore.
### HR Analytics Problem Understanding
While human resource analytics have been revolutionizing the way human resources (HR) departments operate, the method which they are using to collect, process, and analyze the data collected are all largely done manually which is highly inefficient and time-consuming. This problem has been constraining human resources due to their nature and their way of processing and analyzing data. Also, since analytics is not HRâ€™s area of specialization, they may not be able to accurately deem an employee for promotion as compared to a predictive model.
 
Therefore, to solve this problem, I will be building a predictive model that will help HR to identify employees that are most likely to get promoted to lessen their work in the analytics area which they are not specialized in. With the help of a predictive model, HR will be able to identify who is potentially getting promoted without having to manually analyze the large amounts of data themselves. This would help the HR to save time and effort which can be used for other tasks which they are specialized in and increases the accuracy of determining whether an employee is more likely to get promoted or not.

### Airbnb Singapore Problem Understanding
Ever since the launch of Airbnb in 2008, people all around the world have been using Airbnb as a platform for them to either rent their house or rent a house within certain location. For those who are travelling around the globe seeking for an accommodation while trying to live like a local, Airbnb is the platform to find and book such an accommodation. 

While Airbnb hosts generally lease their house at a cheaper rate when compared to hotels, it would make sense for a guest to crave for the lowest fees for the best condition they can find. While some hosts may lower their rental prices slightly to attract more guests, it is impossible and unfeasible for every single host to lower their prices just to satisfy guests since the purpose of renting out their homes would be to earn a profit. 

Therefore, to solve this dispute of coming up with a reasonable rental price, I will be creating a predictive model that would help to predict the ideal rental prices so that both parties will be satisfied.

## Phase One
In Phase One, I will be performing data exploration, data analysis, and data cleansing on both datasets. The purpose of this phase is to prepare the datasets so that it is ready for modelling which will be done in the second phase.

## Phase Two
Phase Two is where I create predictive models for both problems. In this phase, I will be creating multiple predictive models at first and choose the top 3 based on certain criteria that was set by me. After that, I tried to improve the 3 models by using grid search and parameter turning. Overall, once all the tuning has been done, I will select the best model for the specific problem.
